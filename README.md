Hi, this is my first official project from TOP which includes creating the google homepage! 

What have I Learned??
- Created a search bar + move around as well as scale & style 
- Created a navbar for both header & footer as well as move them around 
- Learn proper formatting
- Fixed the border for "Sign in" playing around with padding + marigins 

Currently?
- Google Search
- I'm Feeling Lucky
