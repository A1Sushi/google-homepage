Hi, this is my first official project from TOP which includes creating the google homepage! 

What have I Learned??

- Created a navbar for both header & footer as well as move them around 
- Learn proper formatting
- Fixed the border for "Sign in" playing around with padding + marigins 
- Position buttons, style & scale
